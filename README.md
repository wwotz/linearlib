# linearlib

## What is it 
A C linear algebra library, tested and used in all of my graphics projects. The library was 
designed to be used alongside OpenGL.

## How to use 
Simply copy and paste the files into their src (or your equivalent) and include (or your equivalent) folders and add them 
to compilation, that is all. Additional functionality that is added in the future may require that you call an initialisation 
function in order to prepare data to be accessed, otherwise this is not the case.
